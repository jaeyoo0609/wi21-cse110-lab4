# Part 1

1. The number of elements within prices will be printed, because i stops incrementing when the end of the list is reached.
2. The last discounted price within the array "prices" will be printed, because within the scope of the function, var can change as much it wants.
3. The last final rounded-up price within the array "prices" is printed within the log, similarly to discountedPrice.
4. [50,100,150] will be returned, according to the code within the for-loop.
5. Since i is prefaced with let, its value cannot be printed because it is within the scope of the for-loop block.
6. There will be an error because discountedPrice variable is declared within the scope of the for-loop, thus not being accounted for when the block is completed.
7. The last final rounded-up price within the array "prices" is printed within the log, similarly to discountedPrice.
8. [50,100,150] will be returned, according to the code within the for-loop.
9. Since i is prefaced with let, its value cannot be printed because it is within the scope of the for-loop block.
10. There will be an error because discountedPrice variable is declared within the scope of the for-loop, thus not being accounted for when the block is completed.
11. finalPrice is declared with a const, and is being redeclared within the for-loop, thus causing an error.
12. Because of the const reassignments there are errors, thus making no returned value.
13. Data Types 
    1.  student.name
    2.  student['Grad Year']
    3.  student.greeting()
    4.  student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    5.  student.courseLoad[0]
14. Arithmetic
    1.  32, string conversion
    2.  1, number conversion
    3.  3, null becomes 0
    4.  3null, string conversion
    5.  4, true becomes 1
    6.  0, false and null become 0
    7.  3undefined, string conversion
    8.  NaN, in numberic conversions, undefined becomes NaN
15. Comparison
    1.  true, string 2 becomes number
    2.  false, string comparisons, 2 is greater
    3.  true, string 2 becomes a number
    4.  false, === does strict equality check
    5.  false, true is 1
    6.  true, any Boolean(# > 10) evaluates to true
16. A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion, whereas == is a non-strict check
17. Since 2 does not == true, it goes to the else if and prints 'How are you?'
19. [6,8,10], it adds two to the value, and then mutliplies it by two, then pushes the new value into the array
